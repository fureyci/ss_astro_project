This repository will store any code/files that I use throughout the course of my project.

My goal is to build an ensemble model in python in order to provide more accurate forecasts of solar flares. This will consist of many individual models, namely, those referenced in [this paper](https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-4365/ab2e12/pdf) (Leka et al., 2019). 

As of now, I have been getting used to the type of data I will be working with. This consists of the forecasts of M- and C-class solar flares provided by different models between 1/1/2016 and 31/12/2017, and was accessed [here](https://dataverse.harvard.edu/dataset.xhtml?persistentId=doi:10.7910/DVN/HYP74O) (Leka and Park, 2019).
